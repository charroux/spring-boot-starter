# spring-boot-starter

If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source or commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration. Auto-configuration classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked-up by Spring Boot: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-auto-configuration.html

## the library

Here is an example of a library you want to distribute: https://github.com/charroux/spring-boot-starter/tree/master/me-library

The main code of the library: https://github.com/charroux/spring-boot-starter/blob/master/me-library/src/main/java/me/Me.java
